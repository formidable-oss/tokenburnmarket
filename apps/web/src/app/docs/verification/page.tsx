      <h2 className="type-heading">Receipt streams</h2>
      <p className="mt-3 text-[0.95rem] text-muted">
        A receipt stream is the ordered list of hashes of the per-message identifiers behind a
        day&apos;s usage. Claude Code and Codex both give the collector an identifier per assistant
        message. We hash it and send the hashes, in order. No content, no prompts, no file names.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-3 text-[0.95rem] text-muted">Two things fall out of that:</p>
      <ul className="mt-3 space-y-2 text-[0.95rem] text-muted">
        <li>
          Deduplication. Two machines reading the same transcripts, a laptop and a desktop over a
          synced folder, produce the same hashes, so the day is counted once.
        </li>
        <li>
          Coherence. The number of receipts and the tokens attributed to them have to fit each
          other. A day with enormous totals and a handful of receipts does not.

        play money.

        A determined person can still fabricate a coherent stream. We know. Two things keep that
        from mattering much: the stakes are play money with no way in or out, and your community
        can see your board. If a number looks wrong to the people who know you, it probably is.
